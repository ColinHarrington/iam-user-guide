# Single\-valued vs\. multivalued condition keys<a name="reference_policies_single-vs-multi-valued-condition-keys"></a>

The potential number of values associated with a condition key in the [request context](intro-structure.md#intro-structure-request) of an API call makes the condition key single\-valued or multivalued, not the number of values listed in the policy condition\. Single\-valued condition keys have at most one value in the request context of an API call\. Multivalued condition keys can have more than one value in the request context of an API call\.

For example, a request can originate from at most one VPC endpoint, so [aws:SourceVpce](reference_policies_condition-keys.md#condition-keys-sourcevpce) is a single\-valued condition\. Since a service can have more than one service principal name that belong to the service, [aws:PrincipalServiceNamesList](reference_policies_condition-keys.md#condition-keys-principalservicenameslist) is a multivalued condition key\.

You can use any available single\-valued condition key as a policy variable\. You cannot use a multivalued condition key as a policy variable\. For more information about policy variables, see [IAM policy elements: Variables and tags](reference_policies_variables.md)\.

Multivalued condition keys require condition set operators `ForAllValues` or `ForAnyValue`\. Condition keys that include key\-value pairs such as [aws:RequestTag/*tag\-key*](reference_policies_condition-keys.md#condition-keys-requesttag) and [aws:ResourceTag/*tag\-key*](reference_policies_condition-keys.md#condition-keys-resourcetag) can cause confusion because there can be multiple `tag-key` values\. But since each `tag-key` can have only one value, `aws:RequestTag` and `aws:ResourceTag` are both single\-valued condition keys\. Using condition set operators with single\-valued condition keys can lead to overly permissive policies\.
