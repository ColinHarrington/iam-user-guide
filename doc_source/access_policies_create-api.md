# Creating IAM policies \(AWS API\)<a name="access_policies_create-api"></a>

A [policy](access_policies.md) is an entity that, when attached to an identity or resource, defines their permissions\. You can use the AWS API to create *customer managed policies* in IAM\. Customer managed policies are standalone policies that you administer in your own AWS account\. As a best practice, we recommend that you take the extra step to [validate your policies](access_policies_policy-validator.md) and review and correct any errors or recommendations\. You can then attach the policies to identities \(users, groups, and roles\) in your AWS account\.

The number and size of IAM resources in an AWS account are limited\. For more information, see [IAM and AWS STS quotas, name requirements, and character limits](reference_iam-quotas.md)\.
